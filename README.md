# Regression Model to predict stock prices 


## EXPLANATION
The project consists of creating a price prediction model for S&P 500 assets using linear regression. Linear regression is a statistical technique that seeks to identify a relationship between two variables, in this case, the asset prices and their respective characteristics. With the model, it is possible to obtain an estimate of the future price of the assets. Historical asset data will be used for this purpose.

## DATA
The dataset contains historical stock price data for the companies that make up the S&P 500 index, spanning from 2018 to 2023.

## MODEL 
The Linear Regression model seeks to establish a mathematical relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable, and is an easily interpretable model. In the case of asset price forecasting, it is a good starting point. 

## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMSATION
To select the best parameters, the Grid Search technique was used because the space of possibilities for the parameters of the chosen model is small. 

## RESULTS
In this project, the focus was to structure a simpler version of a model that aims to predict financial asset prices. In future versions, the idea is to use more datasets with information that also influences asset prices and to use more complex models.
